## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light desaturated red (#F1D2D4).
- Accent color: A saturated orange-red (#F45B69) to create visual interest and highlight interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, due to its modern yet neutral style; body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to complement and make lengthier information easier to read
- Use minimalist icons that clearly represent different actions, following the flat design trend.
- Use a clear and intuitive layout, dividing the app into logical sections such as authentication, sales, reporting, and administration.
- Implement subtle transitions when changing views or sections to improve user experience.
